    <header>  <h1 class="heading">Michael Sorkin's List</h1></header>
        
    <p> 
        Michael Sorkin’s list of things an architect should know contains “Accidents must happen” whereas to me I perceive this as accidents must always take place because accidents enable us to find solutions to prevent accidents from occurring. For they are the reason we can adapt and open up paths to achieve proficiency. Accidents are essential for architects to gain insight and continuously improve by what they experience and see. Just as how we as humans cannot grow without making a mistake. There cannot be any good without the bad and so there cannot be any improvement and learning without accidents.

        <p> The moon is beautiful because it shines in the night, I am never alone because the moon always follows me at night whenever I go, without the moon we cannot see the stars at night.</p>
