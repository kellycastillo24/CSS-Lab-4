    <header>  <h1 class="heading">Michael Sorkin's List</h1></header>
        
    <p> 
        Michael Sorkin’s list of things an architect should know contains “Accidents must happen” whereas to me I perceive this as accidents must always take place because accidents enable us to find solutions to prevent accidents from occurring. For they are the reason we can adapt and open up paths to achieve proficiency. Accidents are essential for architects to gain insight and continuously improve by what they experience and see. Just as how we as humans cannot grow without making a mistake. There cannot be any good without the bad and so there cannot be any improvement and learning without accidents.

    <div class="container"> Moonlight 
        <p class="container2"> “If the moon smiled, she would resemble you. You leave the same impression. Of something beautiful, but annihilating. Both of you are great light borrowers.” —Sylvia Plath
            “I’d rather live in a world where I get to love the moon than in one where I don’t, even if the moon won’t return the feeling.” —Alex LondonS

    <!--question 3-->
    <p class="highlight"> The Specht building contains features such a rectangular structure with the university’s color and large windows along with greenery around it. Although the Specht building did not receive the same architectural style as the more “attractive and aesthetic looking” buildings such as Weston Hall or Eberhardt Hall that was not the intention for this building. Rather it served for functional purposes such as providing goods and services and housing the campus bookstore. An example as how it can provide goods such as books and paper anything of value for students. </p>
     <p class="highlight"> While not much is known about the process of the Specht building it is known that it was in 1962 along with other buildings as it was part of a major building program. Yet it seems the building was primarily focused on maintaining campus resources rather than focusing on aesthetics and design as the HCAD building so happens to be behind the Specht building it takes more of the spotlight with its design because that was the intention of this building. The intention of rather than pleasing the world with design but rather pleasing with functionality and maintenance of equipment and goods with an emphasis on that they are to easily be accessed by students. </p>
     <p class="highlight"> Using one’s own analytical skills everyone has a different view on the genre of the Specht building yet I continue to see how rather than the building being used for the aesthetics and design I see it as a building with an efficient role. Dating back to 1962, ever since those moments did NJIT begin to flourish and continue expanding with its major building program. </p>
